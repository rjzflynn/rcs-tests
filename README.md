### Best Practices Implemented
- Each test contains a single assert
- Seperation of Framework and Test code
- Descriptive test names
- Page Object Design Pattern
- Simple, readable test code
- Tests are independent - no dependencies between tests

### The next things I would implement given time
- Reporting plugin to generate test reports
- Consider a BDD framework
- Data-driven tests
